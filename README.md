# Heart Disease Logistic Regression Model With A 77.59% Accuracy Score 

### Heart disease is one of the most common chronic diseases in America, with it amassing almost a fifth of our country's total deaths. Most people who have heart disease find out they have it when more extreme side effects arise, such as a heart attack. This is why it is crucial to optimize prevention and strengthen our ability to predict heart disease before these potentially lethal side effects occur. Every year the CDC (Center for Disease Control) hosts the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which collects important data about heart disease through a telephone survey. My goal was to use the data collected from the survey to design a logistic regression model to classify if someone was to have a heart disease or not. After completing preprocessing, feature engineering, and creating a model, I ended up with an accuracy score of 0.7759. Looking at the accuracy score and confusion matrix, we see the model isnâ€™t ideal but could still be beneficial for a quick at-home preventative screening to make the user more conscious of how much of a role certain factors can play in causing heart disease.
